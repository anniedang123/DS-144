Note that these are dummy values and not the answers\n","- If an autograded question has multiple answers (due to differences in handling NaNs, zeros etc.), all answers will be considered.\n","- Most assignments have bonus questions for extra credit, do try them out! \n","- You can delete the `raise NotImplementedError()` for all manually graded questions.\n","- **Submitting the assignment** : Download the '.ipynb' file from Colab and upload it to canvas. Do not delete any outputs from cells before submitting.\n","- That's about it. Happy coding!
