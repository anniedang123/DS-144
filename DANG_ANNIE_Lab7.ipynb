The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure.

        "The first thing I tried was adding more memory cells and increasing the epochs. I added more memory cells because I figured it's better for the model to hold more information in the hidden layer and possibly even attain more information every increasing time step with more memory cells. I do recognize this is costly because the model would have to learn and optimize a bunch more weights. I increased the number of epochs so that the model can continue training and iteratively improve its weights to improve accuracy. I first started off with smaller increments to add to the current memory cell and epoch values but I still was receiving gibberish when the model was used to generate sequences. Thus, I had to increase it to 110 and 120 to get the desired results of this lab. I then ran this model on 20% validation data and checked the accuracy for each epoch to see if it overfit. Unsurpringly, the data was extremeley overfit, with the accuracy reaching 100% in multiple epochs. This was expected because the goal was to get good yield for the first two sequences and with a severely lacking training set, it's almost impossible not to overfit. In other words, I was aiming for high accuracy so that the sequences could be correct but that also meant the model would have to practically memorize the training data. Thus, in order to prevent overfitting, I tried two techniques: using l2 regularization on kernel_regularizer/activity_regularizer and adding drop out layers. I decided to add regularization on kernal and activity because the kernel regularizer tries to reduce the weights and the activity regularizer tries to reduce the layer's output by reducing weights and adjusting bias. I wanted to focus on reducing weights/bias because adding more epochs allows the model to continue training and thus increases the risk of the weights and biases being tuned to such an extent that the model performs poorly on unseen data. I used L2 regularization because I just wanted a reduction in larger components of the weight matrix instead of a sparser matrix with zeros (as in L1 regularization). I also added dropout layers because I learned that this will help prevent overfitting by ignoring random neurons during training, reducing the sensitivity to specific weights of individual neurons. I used 20% dropout because I read that its a good compromise between retaining accruacy and preventing overfitting. When I implemented the two regularizations and the dropout, I think the data was regularized too much that it began to lose accuracy, therefore, when I ran the sequence generator, the three sequences were back to gibberish. Thus I decided to remove the kernal/activity regularizers and just keep the dropout layers. I then adjusted the memory cells and epoch so that they were lower, but still high enough to achieve good accuracy. This new and final model generated the right sequences for the first two sequences and was still gibberish for the last but that is to be expected. Finally, I ran a 20% validation set through this model and while I still sense overfitting just by looking through the accuracy of each epoch, it was lower than the accuracies of the validation runthrough of the previous model. Overall, the final model still overfits (which is expected if we want high accuracy for the first two sequences from a small training data), but it overfit a lot less than my previous models.\n"
